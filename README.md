# Neovim config
Based on kickstart nvim and modified to suit my workflow.
Setup is on mac M3 Pro, 15.5, with iTerm as my console.

```bash
brew install neovim ripgrep fd
cd ~/.config
git clone git@github.com:jptalusan/neovim.git nvim
```
in ~/.zshrc or bash_profile

```bash
alias vim="nvim"
alias vi="nvim"
```
